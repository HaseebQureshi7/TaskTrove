# TaskTrove

TaskTrove is a professional services platform similar to Fiverr, meticulously crafted using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, with Typescript empowering both the frontend and backend components.

## Project Overview

The project is thoughtfully organized into two primary directories:

- `frontend`: Home to the intuitive React-based user interface.
- `backend`: Hosts the robust Node.js and Express.js backend server.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the TaskTrove environment, ensure that your development machine is equipped with the following tools:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- Git

## Installation and Launch

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Launch the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Backend

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_uri
    PORT=your_preferred_port
    JWT_SK=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```

3. Install dependencies:
